This contains the iconset and logos for Thorium, as well as the Chromium logo, Chromium infrastructure logo, and other logos such as the GitHub logo used in the Readme.md and some logos I used for experimenting around like the 'hamburger logo'. This project also for a small time was called "Technetium", and I experimented with different logo designs; some are lost, but one of them is in the OLD directory. These extra things are in the OLD directory along with the Thorium logos used since the beggining up until M100.

IMPORTANT: The NEW directory is where the new logos that are used since M100 are from. Use this directory for almost all things.

The 'STAGING' dir is for test icons, scratch space, uploading temporary things, etc.
